# FL Plugin Beautifier

### Requirements

* Python 2 or 3
* FL Studio

### How to use

This repo consists of 3 files

 * create.cmd
 * thumbnail.cmd
 * thumbnailer.py



1. Copy the 3 files listed above into the folder where your generators and effects are located
For example to: `C:\Users\....\Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Presets\Plugin database\Generators`
2. Run the ``create.cmd`` file. It will create .png files for every plugin where it does not exist. 
3. Create screenshots of your plugins and save them as the .png file created by `create.cmd`
4. After you have all your screenshots saved, run ``thumbnail.cmd`` to get all the screenshots into the right size as well as the nfo files linking to them. Both the png files and the nfos are hidden after thumbnailing.
5. Open FL Studio and enjoy!
