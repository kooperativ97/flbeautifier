# FL Plugin Beautifier 
## How it works 

This repo consists of 3 files
 * create.cmd
 * thumbnail.cmd
 * thumbnailer.py

You need python 2 or 3 installed. 
You only execute the cmd files. Do not use the pyhton file. 

### How to use

1. Copy the 3 files into the folder where your generators and effects are located
Mine: `C:\Users\....\Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Presets\Plugin database\Generators`

2. Run the create.cmd file. It will create a .nfo and .png for every plugin where these files do not exist. 
   The nfo is hidden per default, the png files are hidden after thumbnailing.

3. Create Screenshots of your Plugins and save them as the .png file created by create.cmd

4. After you have all your screenshots saved, run thumbnai.cmd to get all the screenshots into the right size.

5. Delete the 3 of this repo (if you like)
